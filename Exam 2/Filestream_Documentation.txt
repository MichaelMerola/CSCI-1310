C++ provides the following classes to perform output and input of characters to/from files: 

ofstream: Stream class to write on files
ifstream: Stream class to read from files
fstream: Stream class to both read and write from/to files.

These classes are derived directly or indirectly from the classes istream and ostream. 
We have already used objects whose types were these classes: cin is an object of class istream and cout is an object of class ostream. 
Therefore, we have already been using classes that are related to our file streams. 
And in fact, we can use our file streams the same way we are already used to use cin and cout, with the only difference that we 
have to associate these streams with physical files. 
Let's see an example:

// basic file operations
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  ofstream myfile;
  myfile.open ("example.txt");
  myfile << "Writing this to a file.\n";
  myfile.close();
  return 0;
}
------------------------------------------
(OUTPUT IN FILE)
[file example.txt]
Writing this to a file.

__________________________________________

// writing on a text file
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  ofstream myfile ("example.txt");
  if (myfile.is_open())
  {
    myfile << "This is a line.\n";
    myfile << "This is another line.\n";
    myfile.close();
  }
  else cout << "Unable to open file";
  return 0;
}

__________________________________________

// reading a text file
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  string line;
  ifstream myfile ("example.txt");
  if (myfile.is_open())
  {
    while ( getline (myfile,line) )
    {
      cout << line << '\n';
    }
    myfile.close();
  }

  else cout << "Unable to open file"; 

  return 0;
}

-------------------------------------------
(OUTPUT)
This is a line.
This is another line.
