Trends in Programs
- dynamically add to data structures
- dynamic memory
- vectors, arrays, etc use lots of memory

Two kinds of Memory
- Stack: Local variables managed by processor. 
		 Not a large amount of memory.
- Heap: Much bigger long-term storage, but is not managed by procesor.
		Dynamic memory allocation required to put variables on heap.
		There is an explicit need to free memory to keep program from crashing.
		Allocate large arrays, structures, and objects.
		Need to use pointers for heap variables.
		Keyword for creating - new (malloc)
		Keyword for delete - delete
